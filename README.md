== README

This app is am e-commerce site for needlepoint canvases available to purchase. At this point products can be added and show up on the home page and a user can be created and logged in and out. There is a shopping cart but it's not fully functional. Attaching one cart to one user still needs to be implented as well as a payment gateway. 

I used Ruby on Rails with Bootstrap to style the app. I also used Bcrypt for the login and Paperclip to upload images.
